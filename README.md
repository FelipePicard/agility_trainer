## description

<p>Small wirelessly communicating devices that shine lights in sequence. Depending on the color of the light, the user must do an action. Once the action is completed, the current device changes color and a new device gets a new color as well to indicate to the user what action he/she must do. Colors can be changed randomly and autonomously by the devices themselves, or they can be preprogrammed as a sequence of which device and which color should be picked at each time or a person with a remote can choose the device and color.</p>

<p>This project was based on [this kind of device.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvRM1_2BJDQ)</p>
